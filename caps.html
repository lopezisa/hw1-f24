            <p> CAPS is committed to being the main mental health resource for all students.  We also know, oftentimes, a student's mental and emotional health needs are helped by other student support offices on campus, and/or a student's treatment needs are beyond the scope of CAPS.  This page organizes the many rich resources available at the University of Michigan and in our Ann Arbor community for student mental health and is intended for a variety of constituents -- students, faculty, staff, parents, family members, and loved ones. </p>

        <h3> Individual Peer Counseling</h3>
            <p> Welcome to CAPS Individual Peer Counseling! Individual Peer Counseling (IPC) is designed to offer a new way to meet the needs of students across the University of Michigan. We are here to support student mental health and offer students a place to vent. Peer counselors are trained in active listening by professional staff here at CAPS. The IPC program connects students with someone of a similar age, interest and background who can serve as a resource or simply someone to “rant” to. While Peer Counselors will keep all information private, IPC is not a substitute for confidential therapy provided by a licensed mental health CAPS staff member.  </p>
